# CourseBook Revision App

## Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application for school students to revise from coursebooks, specifically NCERT Class XI Physics PDFs. It includes a source selector, PDF viewer, quiz generator, progress tracking, and a ChatGPT-inspired chat interface with RAG-based answers and citations.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit PyPDF2 langchain langchain-community sentence-transformers google-generativeai python-dotenv requests


Set up a .env file with your Google API key:GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Run the app:streamlit run app.py


Open the provided local URL in a browser.

How to Run

Launch the app with streamlit run app.py.
Use the sidebar to select a PDF, upload new PDFs (e.g., "Md Sohail Ali_CV.pdf"), generate quizzes, or manage chats.
View PDFs in the left column, interact with quizzes or chat in the right column, and track progress at the bottom.

Features Implemented
Must-Have Features

Source Selector: Dropdown to select "All PDFs" or a specific PDF (e.g., "NCERT Physics Ch1.pdf"). Pre-seeded with NCERT PDFs; supports uploads up to 200MB.
PDF Viewer: Displays selected PDF in an iframe, handling both local files and URLs.
Quiz Generator Engine: Generates 1 MCQ, 1 SAQ, and 1 LAQ using Gemini (mock fallback). Users can answer, submit, and view explanations with citations.
Progress Tracking: Dashboard shows attempts, scores, strengths, weaknesses, and detailed results.

Nice-to-Have Features

Chat UI: ChatGPT-inspired with sidebar for chat history, new chat creation, and main chat window. Responsive via Streamlit's wide layout.
RAG Answers with Citations: Includes page numbers and snippets (e.g., "According to NCERT Physics Ch1.pdf, p. 23: ...").
YouTube Video Recommender: Not implemented due to time constraints.

What's Missing

PDF Viewer for Some URLs: URLs may fail due to CORS or network issues; users may need to download and upload PDFs.
Dynamic Quiz Generation: Relies on Gemini with a mock fallback. Could be enhanced with more robust generation.
YouTube Video Recommender: Skipped due to complexity and lack of a client-side API.
Advanced Progress Tracking: Basic dashboard; could include charts or topic-wise analytics.

Development Process

Tech Stack: Streamlit, PyPDF2, LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, Google Gemini API, requests.
LLM Usage: Used Grok to fix the meta tensor error, enhance quiz prompts, and debug PDF viewer and Streamlit layout.
Tradeoffs:
Kept Streamlit for rapid development, limiting UI flexibility compared to React.
Used iframe for PDF viewing; URL-based PDFs require downloading due to Streamlit limitations.
Mocked quiz generation as a fallback for API reliability.
Skipped YouTube recommender to meet deadline.


Commits: Structured to show progress from error fixing to feature implementation.
