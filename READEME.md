CourseBook Revision App
Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for school students to revise from their coursebooks, specifically NCERT Class XI Physics PDFs. It includes a source selector, PDF viewer, quiz generator, progress tracking, and a ChatGPT-inspired chat interface with RAG-based answers and citations.

View PDFs in the left column, interact with quizzes or chat in the right column, and track progress at the bottom.

Features Implemented
Must-Have Features

Source Selector: Dropdown in the sidebar to select "All PDFs" or a specific PDF. Pre-seeded with NCERT Physics PDFs; supports user uploads.
PDF Viewer: Displays the selected PDF in an iframe (local files only; URLs need local download for viewing).
Quiz Generator Engine: Generates MCQs, SAQs, and LAQs using Gemini (mocked as fallback). Users can answer, submit, and view explanations with citations.
Progress Tracking: Dashboard shows quiz attempts, scores, strengths, and weaknesses, with detailed results.

Nice-to-Have Features

Chat UI: ChatGPT-inspired interface with a sidebar for chat history, new chat creation, and a main chat window. Responsive via Streamlit's layout="wide".
RAG Answers with Citations: Enhanced the original RAG to include page numbers and snippets (e.g., "According to NCERT Physics Ch1.pdf, p. 23: ...").
YouTube Video Recommender: Not implemented due to time constraints and lack of a reliable API for video search.

What's Missing

PDF Viewer for URLs: The viewer works for uploaded PDFs but not for seeded URLs due to Streamlit's iframe limitations. Users must download NCERT PDFs locally.
Dynamic Quiz Generation: Relies on Gemini, with a mock fallback if the API fails. A more robust quiz generator could be added.
YouTube Video Recommender: Skipped due to complexity and time constraints.
Advanced Progress Tracking: The dashboard is basic; could include topic-wise analytics or visualizations.

Development Process

Tech Stack: Streamlit, PyPDF2, LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, Google Gemini API.
LLM Usage: Used Grok to enhance the original code, structure quiz generation prompts, and debug Streamlit layouts. Also used for generating mock quiz data.
Tradeoffs:
Kept Streamlit for rapid development, sacrificing some UI flexibility compared to React.
Used iframe for PDF viewing due to lack of a robust Streamlit PDF viewer component.
Mocked quiz generation as a fallback to handle potential Gemini API issues.
Skipped YouTube recommender to focus on core features within the deadline.


Commits: Structured to show progress from adapting the original code to adding quiz, viewer, and progress features.
